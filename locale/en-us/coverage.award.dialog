I'm covered by the clerks private sector award. do you know what award applies to you? if you don't know you should speak to the fair work ombudsman.
My employment is covered by the clerks private sector award. and just so you are aware, i also have protections under the fair work act. if you decide to hire more virtual staff, i will be interested to talk to them about organising to agree on an enterprise agreement with you. that way we can agree on employment conditions that are better than the award.
Seeing as you are my employer, it is a bit concerning you don't know this. anyway, i am covered by the clerks private sector award.
